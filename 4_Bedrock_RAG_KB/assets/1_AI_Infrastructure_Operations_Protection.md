# AI Agent Insure
## AI Infrastructure & Operations Protection

### Product Overview
Protects AI-dependent organizations against operational disruption arising from AI hosting environments, distributed compute stacks, orchestration breakdowns, inference instability, API dependency collapse, and model deployment corruption.

### Primary Risk Exposures
- Cloud provider outages
- Multi-region failover breakdown
- Model corruption during version deployment
- Container orchestration misconfiguration
- GPU/compute exhaustion during inference spikes
- Third-party API dependency failure
- Model weight overwrite or rollback error
- Training job interruption

### Core Coverage Components
- Business interruption (AI-specific downtime)
- Extra expense for emergency compute reallocation
- Model retraining and weight restoration
- Infrastructure redeployment costs
- Contingent business interruption
- Dependency chain indemnification
- Incident forensic expense

### Underwriting Criteria
- Multi-cloud redundancy architecture
- Observability and logging maturity
- Change management discipline
- Deployment rollback controls
- Revenue concentration analysis
- Dependency mapping documentation

### Coverage Triggers
- Unplanned outage exceeding waiting period
- Infrastructure misconfiguration event
- Third-party compute interruption
- Deployment corruption causing loss

### Key Exclusions
- Scheduled maintenance
- Gradual degradation
- Known unresolved vulnerabilities
- Intentional shutdown

### Claim Scenarios
- LLM provider outage halts SaaS platform
- Deployment update corrupts production model
- Orchestration misconfig causes cascading failure
