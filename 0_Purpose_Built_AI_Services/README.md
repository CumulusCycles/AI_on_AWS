# Purpose-built AWS AI Services

This README highlights Purpose-built AWS AI services. These services provide easy-to-integrate APIs for common AI tasks including speech-to-text transcription (Amazon Transcribe), text-to-speech synthesis (Amazon Polly), language translation (Amazon Translate), natural language processing and sentiment analysis (Amazon Comprehend), image and video analysis (Amazon Rekognition), document text and data extraction (Amazon Textract), and conversational AI chatbots (Amazon Lex). Each section below includes features, use cases, and code examples to help you get started.

Note: AWS also offers custom machine learning tools like Amazon SageMaker for building, training, and deploying your own models, but those are not covered in this guide.
