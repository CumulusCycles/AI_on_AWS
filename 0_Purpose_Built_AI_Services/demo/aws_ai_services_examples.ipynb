    "- Amazon Comprehend (Natural Language Processing)\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before setting up, ensure you have the following installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python 3.8+** - Required for running the notebook\n",
    "- **uv** - Fast Python package installer and resolver ([Install uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))\n",
    "- **AWS Account** - With appropriate IAM credentials and permissions\n",
    "- **AWS Credentials** - Configured via `.env` file, `aws configure`, or environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, you need to set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Activate the virtual environment (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual environment was created using `uv`. You can activate it manually, or use `uv run` which automatically uses the venv:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you use `uv run` (Step 4), you don't need to activate the venv manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Install dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Install all required packages using `uv pip install`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5. Register the virtual environment as a Jupyter kernel (Important!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Register the venv's Python as a Jupyter kernel so Jupyter Lab can use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv run python -m ipykernel install --user --name=aws-ai-services --display-name \"Python (AWS AI Services)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This registers the venv kernel so you can select it in Jupyter Lab. You only need to do this once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Configure AWS credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your AWS credentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cp .env.example .env\n",
    "# Edit .env with your actual AWS credentials\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use `aws configure` or set environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Launch Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Start Jupyter Lab using `uv run`. This automatically uses the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv run jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** `uv run` automatically uses the `.venv` virtual environment. When Jupyter Lab opens, select the \"Python (AWS AI Services)\" kernel from the kernel selector.\n",
