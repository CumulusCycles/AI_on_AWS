# Introduction to AI on AWS

AWS offers a comprehensive suite of AI and machine learning services designed to help organizations of all sizes leverage artificial intelligence in their applications. This introduction covers the foundational concepts and provides guidance on how to get started.

## Overview of AWS AI/ML Services
AWS provides both Purpose-built AI Services and tools for building custom machine learning models. Managed services allow you to add AI capabilities to your applications without deep expertise in machine learning, while custom ML tools like SageMaker offer flexibility for data scientists and developers.

### Purpose-built AI Services
- **Amazon Transcribe**: Speech-to-text
- **Amazon Polly**: Text-to-speech
- **Amazon Translate**: Language translation
- **Amazon Comprehend**: Natural language processing
- **Amazon Rekognition**: Image and video analysis
- **Amazon Textract**: Document text and data extraction
- **Amazon Lex**: Conversational AI and chatbots

### Custom Machine Learning
- **Amazon SageMaker**: End-to-end platform for building, training, and deploying ML models
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Managed service for accessing foundation models and building generative AI applications

## Managed Services vs. Custom ML
- **Managed Services**: Pre-built, easy to integrate, require minimal ML expertise, ideal for common use cases (e.g., image recognition, text analysis)
- **Custom ML**: Full control over data, algorithms, and model deployment, suitable for unique or complex requirements
