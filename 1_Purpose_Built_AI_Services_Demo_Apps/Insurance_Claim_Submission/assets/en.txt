Hello, I need to file a claim. My name is Sarah Johnson. My policy number is AC-8923471. I had a car accident yesterday, June 15th, 2024, around 3:30 PM.

I was driving on Highway 101 near the intersection with Main Street in San Francisco, California. It was raining pretty hard, and I was going about 45 miles per hour in the right lane. A blue Honda Accord, license plate 7ABC123, came from behind and rear-ended my 2022 Toyota Camry. The driver was a man named Robert Martinez. He gave me his insurance information—he’s with State Farm Insurance, policy number SF-4567890.

My car has significant damage to the rear bumper and trunk. The tailgate won’t close properly, and there’s some damage to the rear window. The other driver’s car also has front-end damage. We called the police, and Officer Michael Chen from the San Francisco Police Department arrived. He filed a report, case number SF-2024-4872.

I’m okay, but I have some neck and back pain. I went to San Francisco General Hospital Emergency Room last night. They took X-rays and said I might have whiplash. I have a follow-up appointment with Dr. Emily Watson on Monday, June 17th.

My car is currently at Mike’s Auto Body Shop on Market Street. They gave me an initial estimate of $8,500 for repairs, but they need to do a more detailed inspection. I also had to get a rental car from Enterprise Rent-A-Car. That’s costing me about $45 per day.

I have full coverage with your company, Progressive Insurance. My deductible is $500. I really need to get my car fixed quickly because I use it for work—I’m a nurse at Kaiser Permanente Hospital and need to get to my shifts. Can someone please help me get this processed quickly? I’m really stressed out about this whole situation.
