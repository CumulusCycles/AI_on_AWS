Sample files for testing the damage assessment flow:

- **close-up.png**, **straight-on.png**, **wide-angle.png** — Example damage photos for the three required angles.
- **accident_description.txt** — Example accident description.

Use with the Damage Assessment UI or Postman when calling `POST /chat` (initial submission). These are for demonstration only and do not represent real accident photos.
