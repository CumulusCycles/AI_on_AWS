I was along the right side of the road near the curb while driving in snowy conditions. Another vehicle, a red pickup truck traveling in the same direction, struck the rear passenger side of my car. The impact damaged my rear quarter panel, bumper, and tail light. After hitting my vehicle, the pickup continued forward and went up onto the curb, where it knocked over a fire hydrant. I did not strike the other vehicle or the hydrant. My vehicle was damaged as a result of being hit on the rear passenger side.
